# Ethereum Kubernetes Sandbox

The purpose of the project is to simplify the process of launching a private Ethereum cluster, with the main use case
 which is testing Ethereum protocol modifications, private Dapp testing or for running a private blockchain.

Features:

 * supports Parity or Geth
 * run different versions in same cluster
 * fast sync or full sync mode
 * blockchain monitoring tools
 * cluster monitoring tools
 * scheduled operations over the cluster (backup, restore, etc)
 * secure access

## System requirements

### Docker

You need Docker to build container images, download Docker for your platform: https://www.docker.com/products/overview

### Kubernetes

Currently EtherKube is being tested against Google Cloud Container, and you have to download latest Gcloud SDK tool
from https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads

Then install Kubernetes command line client:
----
gcloud components install kubectl
----

### Rust Compiler

You need Rust compiler and Cargo tool to build Etherkube command line utility. Most simple way would be to install
Rustup from https://www.rustup.rs/, which will install and will help you to manage all required Rust components.

## Usage

### 0. Compile tools

----
make
----

### 1. Setup Cloud provider

To start you have to create a new Google Cloud project with a Cloud Containers cluster.

* Google Cloud - https://console.cloud.google.com
* Cloud Containers (GKE) - https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list?project=

### 2. Configure EtherKube

For Google Cloud project Id is `my_project_id` and a Cloud Container Cluster named `test-cluster-1` run following:

----
cp etherekube-config.samle.yaml etherekube-config.yaml
vim etherekube-config.yaml
./bin/etherkube init
----

### 3. Copy binaries

Copy Geth compiled binary for Linux in `./containers/geth-provided/` directory

### 4. Deploy Geth to the cloud

----
./bin/etherkube deploy geth-provided
----

### 5. Watch how it works

----
kubectl logs --tail=10 -f <node-geth-XXXX>
----

(it's safe to Ctrl-C at any moment, to detach from remote log)


### shtftnet

```
vim etherekube-config.yaml
./bin/etherkube init
./bin/etherkube deploy node-1(name that mached to the etherekube-config.yaml)
```
